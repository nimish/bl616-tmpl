Strips out the custom CMake defs in the [bouffalo_sdk](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bouffalo_sdk) 

TODO:
1. Add other chips
2. Use fully open source post process and flasher
    * [flash](https://git.lerch.org/lobo/blflashcommand)
    * [post process](https://github.com/Fishwaldo/bflb_fw_post_proc)
4. Use more upstream code for the included projects (lvgl, cherryusb, lwip, fs, nuttx,..)
5. RF -- no idea how this works. Post proc and flasher both do something here with binary libs.
